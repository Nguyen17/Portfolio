# How it began ... 

I first heard of Jekyll while browsing through Reddit months ago and as I continue reading the comments in several subreddits they all have the same theme. <br>

<em>Jekyll is really good for simple static sites. </em> 

Fast forward to now. I wanted to update my portfolio and decided why not use Jekyll since its been mention many times.

To start the installation of Jekyll, I refer to its [main site](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

I have to say it was very simple. If you have ruby already installed.
it was literally

```
$ gem install jekyll

```
<p>*refer to the site for installation *</p>

After reading through the documentation on the main site, I decided to use a theme called [Leonids](https://github.com/renyuanz/leonids).

So far, I am pretty happy with the process and am still surprise at the learning curve of Jekyll. 

For future readers, I definately recommend to use this framework for simple sites and blogs.
